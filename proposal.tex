\section{Proposal}

Interactive visual website. Most likely using matter.js or some other 2D physics library. Will involve coding. Will have to research basic physics simulation most likely just adjust scale and gravitation constants. We will aim for 3-body simulations and then attempt to generalize to n-bodies. We hope to start with a minimum viable product and build upon it with features for simulating different with different adjustable parameters.
